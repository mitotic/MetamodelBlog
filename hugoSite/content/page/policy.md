## Disclaimer

This is a personal blog. The opinions expressed here are my own and do not in any way represent the official opinions of my employer.


## Privacy

This blog uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static website generator, and
[Remark42](https://remark42.com) for comment handling. Both are open source
products and are hosted on a dedicated server for this blog.

If you are just reading the blog, no personally identifiable information is
collected by the static website. There are no ads or affiliate links. There is
embedded
[Google Analytics](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) code
that aggregates generic usage statistics.

To append a comment to a blog post, you will need to login with a social account
(Google/Facebook). The user's name is used to label the comment. Your name is
not used for any purpose other than the authentication for commenting, and no
other information about your account is collected. In particular, the commenting
information is not shared with Google Analytics. (The comment handling software,
Remark42, runs in a separate docker container and is unaware of the Google
Analytics code in the static web site.)

## Commenting

To express your opinion, you have two options:

- You can use Twitter to simply reply to the tweet announcing the blog post, which is automatically appended at the end
  of each post. 

- If you don't wish to use a tweet for your comment, or if your comment is long,
you can comment on the post at [metamodel.blog](https://metamodel.blog)
website. You will need to authenticate using a Google or Facebook account to do
that. (Anonymous comments are disabled to prevent spam.)

Contrarian opinions are welcome, if expressed politely and supported with some
evidence. Misleading and offensive comments will be deleted and repeat offenders
will be blocked.
